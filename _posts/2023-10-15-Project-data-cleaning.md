# Purpose
YouTube has been an important part of my life, I'm not proud of how much time I have spent watching videos, but to be fair I have learned a lot thanks to YouTube. Along with that, my wife's doing culinary arts, so watching receipts, experiments, and food around the world makes us wonder about how will be to start a YouTube channel. Fortunately, in one of my data science classes, I needed to gather some data and make an analysis about it. Then, I decided to scrape data from YouTube and tried to find insights.
